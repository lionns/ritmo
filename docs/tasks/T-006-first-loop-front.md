title: The first loop, front half — the portfolio you open and the entry you write
status: ready
profile: team
harness: 0.8.1
role: Frontend Implementer
goal: Build the landing surface and the log form from the approved design, against the endpoints
  T-005 exposes, so opening Ritmo shows what moved and writing an entry takes seconds.
decisions: [D-008, D-009]
implements: [US-3, NFR-1]

## Sources

- `docs/project/design-handoff.md` — the whole file. Tokens, the hero chart, motion, navigation,
  accessibility. It is the authority here, not the artboards.
- `https://claude.ai/code/artifact/c21822cb-584e-4600-8f31-0b9afbc8d629` — the approved screens
- `docs/project/architecture.md` § Layout · `docs/tasks/T-005-first-loop-back.md` § Scope

## Scope

- `src/pages/index.astro` — the portfolio. What moved, before what is outstanding.
- `src/pages/registrar.astro` — the log form, one field first.
- `src/components/` — atoms, molecules and organisms per `D-008`, and `src/layouts/` for the shell.
- The hero chart as an inline SVG built from the portfolio response, with its three states and its
  legend naming the unit.
- Tailwind tokens wired from `design-handoff.md`, both palettes, with the theme following the
  viewer's setting.
- An island only where one is earned: the form's submit, so writing does not cost a page load.

## Out of Scope

- **Every other screen.** The weekly close, the dormant project and the project detail are later.
- **Navigation beyond what exists.** The wordmark returns to `/`; the archive and settings links
  from `design-handoff.md` § Navigation Map render but may point nowhere yet.
- **Identity.** No sign-in screen. `T-005` seeds the owner.
- **Reading data directly.** `.astro` files import `contracts/` only and reach data through
  `/api/*` (`D-009`). A template touching an adapter is a failed baseline, not a review note.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WHEN the owner opens `/`, THE SYSTEM SHALL render recent progress above any outstanding work
      (`AC-G1`), with no streak, counter, badge or debt anywhere on the page (`AC-X4`, `NFR-7`).
- [ ] The hero chart renders the three states of `design-handoff.md` — nothing logged, logged
      without minutes, logged with minutes — and carries its legend naming days and unit.
- [ ] 28 marks at desktop widths and 14 below 768px.
- [ ] WHEN an entry is written from `/registrar`, THE SYSTEM SHALL persist it through `/api/entries`
      and the next render of `/` SHALL show it.
- [ ] Every interactive target is at least 56px tall on desktop and 58px on mobile, and no
      decorative element extends past a hit area.
- [ ] The entry animation completes within 400ms end to end, and `prefers-reduced-motion` removes it.
- [ ] Both palettes render, contrast matches the measured table in `design-handoff.md`, and `faint`
      carries no text — `faint-text` does.
- [ ] Accent covers roughly 2% of each screen, and no error state uses red (`NFR-8`).
- [ ] `npm run check:core` stays green, proving no `.astro` file reached past `contracts/`.
- [ ] All five gates stay green from a clean `npm ci`.

## Verification

- Baseline: the five gates, then `node scripts/harness-lint.mjs`.
- Final: the same, plus `node scripts/harness-status.mjs`.
- Task-specific: `npm run db:reset && npm run seed && wrangler dev`, then open `/` at 390px and at
  1440px, write an entry, and confirm it appears. This is the first task whose result is looked at.
- Task-specific: reload with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` and confirm the bars arrive at their
  final height with no animation.

## Assumptions

- **`T-005` is done and its contract is stable.** This task consumes it and does not change it; a
  needed change is a finding against `T-005`, not a silent edit here.
- **The design handoff outranks the artboards** where they disagree, which they do on one point
  already: the artboards use `faint` for text and the token table forbids it.

## Risks

- `backdrop-filter` is capped at two glass surfaces per screen by `design-handoff.md`. The portfolio
  already wants one; the form wants another. A third needs a measurement, not a judgement call.
- This is the first task with a visual result, so "looks right" will be tempting as a check. Every
  criterion above is either a command or an observation someone else can repeat.
